      "(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC's founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday's ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court's treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What's objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine's decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court's decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN's Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.\n",

       "'(CNN)The Palestinian Authority officially became the 123rd member of the International Criminal Court on Wednesday, a step that gives the court jurisdiction over alleged crimes in Palestinian territories. The formal accession was marked with a ceremony at The Hague, in the Netherlands, where the court is based. The Palestinians signed the ICC\\'s founding Rome Statute in January, when they also accepted its jurisdiction over alleged crimes committed \"in the occupied Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, since June 13, 2014.\" Later that month, the ICC opened a preliminary examination into the situation in Palestinian territories, paving the way for possible war crimes investigations against Israelis. As members of the court, Palestinians may be subject to counter-charges as well. Israel and the United States, neither of which is an ICC member, opposed the Palestinians\\' efforts to join the body. But Palestinian Foreign Minister Riad al-Malki, speaking at Wednesday\\'s ceremony, said it was a move toward greater justice. \"As Palestine formally becomes a State Party to the Rome Statute today, the world is also a step closer to ending a long era of impunity and injustice,\" he said, according to an ICC news release. \"Indeed, today brings us closer to our shared goals of justice and peace.\" Judge Kuniko Ozaki, a vice president of the ICC, said acceding to the treaty was just the first step for the Palestinians. \"As the Rome Statute today enters into force for the State of Palestine, Palestine acquires all the rights as well as responsibilities that come with being a State Party to the Statute. These are substantive commitments, which cannot be taken lightly,\" she said. Rights group Human Rights Watch welcomed the development. \"Governments seeking to penalize Palestine for joining the ICC should immediately end their pressure, and countries that support universal acceptance of the court\\'s treaty should speak out to welcome its membership,\" said Balkees Jarrah, international justice counsel for the group. \"What\\'s objectionable is the attempts to undermine international justice, not Palestine\\'s decision to join a treaty to which over 100 countries around the world are members.\" In January, when the preliminary ICC examination was opened, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu described it as an outrage, saying the court was overstepping its boundaries. The United States also said it \"strongly\" disagreed with the court\\'s decision. \"As we have said repeatedly, we do not believe that Palestine is a state and therefore we do not believe that it is eligible to join the ICC,\" the State Department said in a statement. It urged the warring sides to resolve their differences through direct negotiations. \"We will continue to oppose actions against Israel at the ICC as counterproductive to the cause of peace,\" it said. But the ICC begs to differ with the definition of a state for its purposes and refers to the territories as \"Palestine.\" While a preliminary examination is not a formal investigation, it allows the court to review evidence and determine whether to investigate suspects on both sides. Prosecutor Fatou Bensouda said her office would \"conduct its analysis in full independence and impartiality.\" The war between Israel and Hamas militants in Gaza last summer left more than 2,000 people dead. The inquiry will include alleged war crimes committed since June. The International Criminal Court was set up in 2002 to prosecute genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. CNN\\'s Vasco Cotovio, Kareem Khadder and Faith Karimi contributed to this report.'"

       "'नोट के बदले वोट मामले में आरोपी समाजवादी पार्टी के पूर्व महासचिव और राज्यसभा सदस्य अमर सिंह को रविवार को दिल्ली के अखिल भारतीय आयुर्विज्ञान संस्थान (एम्स) से छुट्टी मिल गई। अस्पताल से बाहर आते ही सिंह ने कहा कि वह सपा से जुड़े अपने अतीत को हमेशा के लिए भूलना चाहते हैं।  इससे पहले एम्स के गुर्दा रोग विशेषज्ञ डॉक्टर संजय गुप्ता ने बताया कि सिंह फिट हैं और उन्हें छुट्टी दे दी गई है। डॉक्टर गुप्ता ही एम्स में 55 साल के एम्स का उपचार कर रहे थे। सिंह को वोट के बदले नोट मामले में 6 सितंबर को गिरफ्तार कर लिया गया था। स्वास्थ्य आधार पर अदालत ने 24 अक्टूबर को उन्हें जमानत दे दी थी। सिंह को तिहाड़ जेल से 12 सितंबर को एम्स में भर्ती कराया गया था।  सिंगापुर में गुर्दे का प्रत्यारोपण कराने वाले सिंह के गुर्दे में पिछले दिनों कुछ परेशानियां आ गई थीं।  \\xa0गुप्ता ने कहा, उनकी हालत अब ठीक है। उनकी सेहत अब पहले से बेहतर है। जब उन्हें यहां लाया गया था तो उनके क्रिएटिनिन की मात्रा में उतार-चढ़ाव आ रहा था। इसके साथ ही उन्हें कुछ अन्य परेशानियां भी थीं।  अस्पताल से बाहर निकलते समय अभिनेत्री और लोकसभा सदस्य जयाप्रदा उनके साथ थीं। सिंह ने संवाददाताओं से कहा, मैं सभी लोगों से आग्रह करता हूं कि सपा के साथ मेरा नाम नहीं जोड़ा जाए। मैं सपा से जुड़े इतिहास को भूलना चाहता हूं। उन्होंने कहा कि गुर्दे के प्रत्यारोपण के बाद से मैं उपाचार के लिए सिंगापुर जाता रहा हूं। कुछ वक्त से मैं वहां जा नहीं पा रहा हूं। मैं सिंगापुर जाने के लिए अदालत से इजाजत मांगूगा।  व्हील चेयर पर बैठे सिंह ने कहा कि मूत्र नली में संक्रमण हो गया था। अभी मैं इससे पूरी तरह उबर नहीं पाया हूं। मेरे बच्चे बुखार से पीड़ित हैं। चिकित्सकों ने मुझसे 3 नवम्बर को जरूरत पड़ने पर दोबारा जांच कराने को कहा है। सिंह के गुर्दे में क्रिएटिनिन का स्तर बढ़ जाने के बाद उन्हें एम्स में भर्ती कराया गया था। क्रिएटिनिन गुर्दे के काम करने की द्योतक होता है।'"
